<h1>About me</h1> 

<h2> Welcome to my Portfolio Website! </h2>

<p>My Configuration Management career began as a Department of Defense (DoD) contractor supporting the National Geospatial Agency (NGA) Configuration Management team. I transitioned from Document Control to Configuration Management because I desired challenging work that would lead to a rewarding career that offers unlimited growth opportunities. </p>
